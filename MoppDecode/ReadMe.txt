Utility for extraciting some more or less important data from NIF-file
(Skyrim version)

Uses modified niflib from git://niftools.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/niftools/niflib

Code comes without any warranty and 'as is'. 

Comments:
- Code is 'quick and very! dirty' ;-)
- didn't got niflib compiled as lib, so files are included in project
- compiled with MSVC 2005
- many changes/add-ons to niflib matching actual NIF structure

Usage:
1. Choose NIF-file (Skyrim version) containing model.
2. Choose output you want to be created
3. Press Convert

I recomment the creation of readable MoppCode ;-)
